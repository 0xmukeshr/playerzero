# Client-Side Player Zero Game

## 🎮 Overview

**Player Zero** has been converted from a client-server architecture to a **client-side only** implementation. This means:

- ❌ **No backend server required**
- ✅ **Pure client-side gameplay**
- ✅ **Browser localStorage for persistence**
- ✅ **Simulated multiplayer experience**
- ✅ **Easy deployment to any static hosting**

## 🔄 What Changed

### Before (Client-Server)
- Required running `server.js` on Node.js
- Used Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Server managed game state and validation
- WebSocket connections between clients

### After (Client-Side Only)
- Uses React Context (`PeerContext`) for state management
- localStorage for game persistence
- Simulated multiplayer using local state
- No server dependencies required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

├── context/
│   └── PeerContext.tsx     # Replaces SocketContext
├── components/
│   ├── GameLobby.tsx       # Updated for localStorage
│   └── GameInterface.tsx   # Updated for PeerContext

```

### Key Components

#### 1. PeerContext (`src/context/PeerContext.tsx`)
- **Replaces**: SocketContext + server.js
- **Manages**: Game state, player actions, timers
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistence
- **Features**: Host/client simulation, action processing

#### 2. Game Storage
- **Public Games**: `localStorage.getItem('publicGames')`
- **Game State**: `localStorage.getItem('game_${gameId}')`
- **Persistence**: Survives browser refresh

#### 3. Multiplayer Simulation
- **Host Player**: Manages game logic and timers
- **Client Players**: Send actions to host simulation
- **State Sync**: Simulated through React state updates

## 🎯 How It Works

### Game Creation
1. Player clicks "Create Game"
2. `PeerContext.createGame()` generates game ID
3. Game stored in localStorage
4. Player becomes "host" of the game

### Joining Games
1. Player sees public games list (from localStorage)
2. Clicks "Join Game" or enters Game ID
3. `PeerContext.joinGame()` adds player to game
4. Game state updated in localStorage

### Game Logic
1. **Host** runs all game timers and logic
2. **Players** send actions via `sendAction()`
3. **Host** processes actions and updates state
4. **All players** see updated state immediately

### Market & Timer
- **Host-only**: Runs market fluctuations and round timer
- **60-second rounds**: Automatic progression
- **Real-time updates**: All players see changes instantly

## 🔧 Deployment

### Static Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
# Upload 'dist' folder to:
# - Netlify
# - Vercel
# - GitHub Pages
# - Any static hosting
```

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Accessible at http://localhost:5173
```

## 🎮 Features Preserved

### ✅ All Original Features Work
- **Resource Trading**: Buy, Sell, Burn, Sabotage
- **Market Dynamics**: Price fluctuations every 5 seconds
- **Round System**: 20 rounds, 60 seconds each
- **Player Stats**: Real-time leaderboard
- **Pixel Art Theme**: Complete retro aesthetic
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and background music

### ✅ Enhanced Features
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet
- **Instant Deployment**: No server setup required
- **Browser Persistence**: Games survive page refresh
- **Zero Latency**: No network delays

## 📋 Limitations

### 🚨 Current Limitations
1. **Single Browser**: Multiplayer limited to same browser tabs
2. **No Real P2P**: No actual WebRTC implementation yet
3. **Host Dependency**: Game stops if host closes browser
4. **Storage Limits**: localStorage has size constraints

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
1. **WebRTC P2P**: Real peer-to-peer connections
2. **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud save integration
3. **Room Codes**: Shareable game links
4. **Spectator Mode**: Watch ongoing games

### Key Files
- **`PeerContext.tsx`**: Core game logic and state
- **`GameLobby.tsx`**: Game creation and joining
- **`GameInterface.tsx`**: Main gameplay interface
- **`useGames.ts`**: localStorage-based game management

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Players
- **Instant Play**: No server setup or maintenance
- **Always Available**: Works offline
- **Fast Performance**: No network latency
- **Easy Sharing**: Just share the URL

### For Developers
- **Simple Deployment**: Static hosting only
- **No Backend**: No server costs or complexity
- **Easy Development**: Pure frontend stack
- **Portable**: Runs anywhere browsers work

## 🎊 Get Started

```bash
# Clone and run immediately
git clone <repo>
cd project
npm install
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173
